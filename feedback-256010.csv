The sooner,the better.I have a strong background in boolean logic (AND/OR),so I am keen to start asap this basic training.
Henry Ford said that you must learn until your death.I have nothing to lose except TIME.And TIME is not on my side.
It's my fault that I didn't requested this training 5 years earlier.In Romania I work at the Craiova Engine plant & I have a small job opportunity to promote as PLC specialist.I can't find words to say THANKS to Iva & uou,because you both don't know me.
Thanks for your attention & increased profit for Rockwell Automation.
Kind regards,
